### Cooperation plan

#### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

#### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

#### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

#### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

- Francisco: Debugging, conditional logic, technical documentation, “linked lists” - like structures. I see myself using my strengths to help the team move past stucks. I want to develop my strength further in SQL management.

- Heather: UI/UX, Product Mgmt, Design. I’m excited to work with relational databases and AWS.

- Ike: Backend & time management - Be a source of information to help set up backend, do regular check ins & make sure everyone is taking regular breaks. I want to learn more about proper database flow. I plan to approach the day to day by showing up & doing my best.

- Nick: Good with AI, Front end dev, conceptual ideas, usually leadership(Current crisis not helping)

- Katie: Troubleshooting and debugging, want to become more familiar with databases and AWS.

- Malik: Concepts and high level understanding, git, backend. I would like to improve my problem solving abilities as we navigate different blockers.

### Conflict Plan

#### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

- Have open dialog amongst the group. If a resolution cannot be achieved internally, the issue will be escalated to the lead instructor in a timely manner.

#### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

- Have an open dialog amongst the group. If the issue cannot be resolved, we will contact our lead instructor.

#### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- With patience and an open mind. It is important to know that not one of us knows it all, and we can use each other to help in areas we might struggle with.

#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

- We will discuss our progress during daily meetings.

#### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

- Shortly after the attempt was made will the issue be escalated as there is not much time to execute the project.

### Communication Plan

#### What hours will you be available to communicate?

- Plan to be available during class hours.

#### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Slack and Remo.

#### How often will you take breaks?

- Definitely lunch breaks are mandatory, otherwise be human and communicate. Every hour if you can step away for at least 5!!

#### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- Re-visit with each other, look at features, reassess the MVP

#### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

#### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

- Maintaining a safe workspace

#### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

- Regular check-ins with everyone during stand up.

### Work Plan

#### How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

- As a team we will flush out a Kanban board to identify needed tasks. Utilizing a stand up at the beginning of each work session to communicate where we all are in the process.

#### What project management tool will be used?

- We plan to use a Trello board to be able to identify needed tasks and be able to move them around to signify what is already being worked on and what is done.

### Schedule Practice Session

- Plan on Thursday to do a walkthrough and touch base with the instructor, then the morning of Friday June 16th do a quick walk through before presentations.

### Git Process

#### What components of your project will live on GitHub?

- Backend code will live on GitHub

#### How will you share the repository with your teammates?

- We are all part of the organization, so that everyone has access to both repositories.

#### What is your Git flow?

- Don’t work in main or dev
- New Branches for each feature
- Whenever a Pull Request is completed into dev, message in Slack so all devs know to pull down

#### How many people must review a PR?

- 1 person required for both Main branch & Dev branch

#### Who merges PRs?

- The person who reviews the PR, not the person who made the PR request

#### How often will you merge?

- Merge into dev on feature completion with the review of another, merge into main at the end of each work day with at least 2 people present

#### How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

- Either through Remo or communicate through slack and wait for confirmation from a member of the team. Once merge is complete, notify via Slack.
