# Final CodeFellows 401 Project

## Project: Helen House Application: FrontEnd

### Authors: Francisco Sanchez, Heather Holcomb, Katherine Lee, Malik Sadiki-Torres, Nick Mullaney, and Ike Steoger

### Problem Domain

The problem weâ€™re solving is the need for a secure and efficient database application that can handle large amounts of demographic data, simplify the process of collecting this information, and provide easy querying for Helen House, a rural LGBTQ+ youth center. This solution will not only digitize their current paper-based data collection but also enhance data accuracy, accessibility, and the ability to generate insights for grant applications.
